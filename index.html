        Fathers, like mothers, are pillars in the development of a child's emotional well-being. 
        Children look to their fathers to lay down the rules and enforce them. 
        They also look to their fathers to provide a feeling of security, both physical and emotional.
        A responsibility to lead.
        a responsibility to seek God's will 
        a responsibility to pray and worship 
        a responsibility to protect the beautiful, the innocent and the good
        and a responsibility to provide for those we love and lead.
        Children look to their fathers to lay down the rules and enforce them. 
        They also look to their fathers to provide a feeling of security, both physical and emotional. 
        Children want to make their fathers proud, and an involved father promotes inner growth and strength.
        Finally, on this Father's day, it is important to recognize and reward dads for being there, and actively teaching important life skills to children.
